# SpaceInvader
This was the final project for our Java programming course in Universidad Carlos 3 de Madrid. 
As it is t a spanish university, the names and commentary in the code are written in spanish.
This was a group project done with Mónica García Ocaña.

*Explanation*
The university gave us a GUI within which we would start programming the videogame. We started by creating board and objects inside of the board.
We attached the corresponding images to the objects. Then came adding movement to the objects, for the herd of enemies we had used an array to create them as a block. 
Making the herd as a block made it easy for doing a pregame ritual in which the enemies perform a small dance aroung the board before finding their position and startint to move towards the player.
The hardest, yet most useful method we developed was the a find spot algorithm. It was a boolean in which we would have the original spot (which during the course of the game would change) saved, and we added/subtracted values to X and Y until actual spor = original spot.
With this method we were able to make the pregrame ritual, make enemies attack the player and the return to the herd and in case any bugs occured enemies would akwardly return to their position.

*Conclusion*
It was a lot of fun making this simple videogame. Sorry for the messy coding and the spanish commentaries! It was my first coding experience and real project and just wanted to showcase it to anyone who might be doing something similar. Enjoy!
